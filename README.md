# Fractals-with-turtle

In this repo each file does a different fractal with the python3 library turtle (Xming or a similar program is needed to visualize de results).

I did this fractals for a contest of my university, when I was in 1st year. The fractal I submited is generated by Espirals.py.
Although I didn't win the contest, I had a lot of fun experimenting with the library turtle and with the fractals.
